# Java Upskilling Training notes

## Switch Statement
* The switch statement in Java is a control flow statement that allows you to execute one block of code among many based on the value of an expression. It is an alternative to the if-else-if ladder and provides a more readable and efficient way to handle multiple conditions.

## JUnits testing
### 1st Version
```
    @Test
    @DisplayName("")
    public void nameOfMethod(){
        // Arrange
        int time = 21;
        String expected = "Good evening";
        // Act
        String actual = App.getGreeting(time);
        //Assert
        Assertions.assertEquals(expected, actual);
    }
```
### 2nd Version
```
    @ParameterizedTest
    @CsvSource({
            "What you're expecting, 2",
            "What you're expecting, 8",
            "What you're expecting, 15",
            "What you're expecting, 21"
    })
    public void nameOfMethod(String expected,int time){
        Assertions.assertEquals(expected, App.getGreeting(time));
    }
```

### 3rd Version
```
    @ParameterizedTest
    @ValueSource(ints = {19, 23}) // this is where you put the range/boundaries
    @DisplayName("getGreeting, when a given time 19 to 23, returns good evening")
    public void nameOfMethod(int time){
        Assertions.assertEquals("Good evening", App.getGreeting(time));
    }
```


## Loops(For/ For each , While/ Do While)




## OOP
* Abstraction: Is the concept of classes, which they then are the blueprints of real life objects
* An object is the instance of a class

* Encapsulation: concept of data hiding & exposing e.g. thru private & public methods & variables
* Polymorphism: different implementations of the same thinghas two types: method overriding & method overloading
* Inheritance: a hierarchical relationship between classes (e.g. subclasses)



## SOLID Principle
### S â€“ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

*ðŸ‘‰ A class should have only one reason to change.

* In retail: One class shouldnâ€™t handle inventory management, payments, and receipts all at once.

### O â€“ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

*ðŸ‘‰ Open for extension, closed for modification.

* In retail: If the store adds new discount strategies (e.g., Christmas sale, Black Friday), we shouldnâ€™t rewrite the old discount logic.

### L â€“ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

* ðŸ‘‰ Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering correctness.
* In retail: A regular customer and a loyalty program customer should both work anywhere the system expects a Customer.

### I â€“ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

* ðŸ‘‰ Clients shouldnâ€™t be forced to depend on methods they donâ€™t use.

* In retail: A cash register doesnâ€™t need to know about online delivery. An online order system doesnâ€™t need to handle cash payments.

### D â€“ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

* ðŸ‘‰ Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.

* In retail: A checkout system shouldnâ€™t depend directly on MySQLDatabase or OracleDatabase. It should just depend on a Database interface.
